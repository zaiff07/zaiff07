## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<br>
## About Me:
<br>
Hi, Iâ€™m Zaiff, an Electrical Engineer passionate about coding, motor diagnostics and development!
<br>
<br>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on VFD simulation and motor diagnostics using ANSYS Maxwell and An AI-powered chatbot using Python for customer support.!
<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning algorithms using Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn), and exploring advanced partial discharge analysis for electric motors.
<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to motor diagnostics, VFD simulations. 
<br>
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with co-simulating partial discharge in motors using FEA, and optimizing motor performance.
