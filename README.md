## About Me:
<br>
<br>
Hi, Iâ€™m Zaiff, an Electrical Engineer passionate about coding, motor diagnostics and development! Iâ€™m currently working on awesome projects.
<br>
<br>
## âš¡ Skills:
<br>
<br>
- **Languages**: Python, Dart, C++
<br>
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, ANSYS Maxwell, MATLAB
<br>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on VFD simulation and motor diagnostics using ANSYS Maxwell and An AI-powered chatbot using Python for customer support.!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning algorithms using Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn), and exploring advanced partial discharge analysis for electric motors.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to motor diagnostics, VFD simulations. 
<br>
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with co-simulating partial discharge in motors using FEA, and optimizing motor performance.
